  api_overview: The schematron module provides an implementation of the Schematron
    schema validation specification. Its primary responsibility is to parse and compile
    Schematron schemas (written in XML) into an internal representation, and then
    use this compiled schema to validate XML instance documents. It identifies assertions
    and reports based on XPath expressions defined within the schema, providing mechanisms
    for reporting validation results.
