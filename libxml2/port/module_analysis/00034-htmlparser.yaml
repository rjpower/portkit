  api_overview: The HTMLparser module is a core component of libxml2 responsible for
    parsing HTML documents. It implements an HTML5-compliant tokenizer but uses a
    custom, non-standard tree construction algorithm (not fully HTML5-compliant).
    Its primary responsibility is to convert HTML input (from files, memory, or I/O
    streams) into an in-memory tree structure (DOM) or to generate SAX events. It
    also provides functionalities for serializing HTML documents back to various outputs,
    including handling HTML-specific features like meta encoding tags and boolean
    attributes. It aims to be robust in handling malformed HTML.
