  api_overview: The chvalid module implements character range validation APIs, primarily
    for Unicode characters, to ensure compliance with XML specifications. It provides
    functions and macros to check if a given character belongs to specific XML character
    categories such as base characters, digits, combining characters, and more. It
    efficiently handles both single-byte and multi-byte character ranges using pre-generated
    lookup tables and binary search algorithms.
