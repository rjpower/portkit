  api_overview: The 'pattern' module in libxml2 provides functionality for compiling
    and matching XPath-like patterns against XML nodes. It supports both traditional
    tree-based matching for existing DOM nodes and a streaming interface for efficient,
    incremental pattern evaluation during parsing or for large documents. This module
    is crucial for features like XML Schema Identity Constraints (selectors and fields)
    and general XPath-based node selection.
