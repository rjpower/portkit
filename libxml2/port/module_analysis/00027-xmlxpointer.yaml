  api_overview: The xpointer module provides an API for evaluating XML Pointer (XPointer)
    expressions against XML documents. It implements support for the 'element()' scheme
    (W3C Proposed Recommendation 2002), 'xpath1()' (an alias for XPath 1.0), and 'xpointer()'
    (also an alias for XPath 1.0). It also includes support for the 'xmlns()' scheme
    to initialize namespaces for XPath evaluation. The module handles the cascading
    evaluation of multiple XPointer parts, where subsequent parts are evaluated if
    previous ones fail to locate a sub-resource. It aims to resolve XPointer expressions
    to specific locations (nodesets) within an XML document.
