  api_overview: The catalog module provides a generic set of routines for handling
    XML and SGML catalogs. Its primary responsibility is to resolve external identifiers
    (Public IDs, System IDs, and URIs) to local resources or alternative URIs based
    on rules defined in catalog files. It implements the specifications from SGML
    Open Technical Resolution TR9401:1997 and XML Catalogs Working Draft 06 August
    2001, allowing applications to map external identifiers to local copies of DTDs,
    schemas, or other resources, improving offline usability and network efficiency.
