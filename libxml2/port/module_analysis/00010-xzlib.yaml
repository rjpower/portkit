  api_overview: This module provides a transparent I/O layer for libxml2 to handle
    compressed files, specifically supporting LZMA and optionally gzip formats. It
    abstracts away the decompression details, allowing other parts of libxml2 to read
    from compressed files as if they were uncompressed, using a file-like interface.
