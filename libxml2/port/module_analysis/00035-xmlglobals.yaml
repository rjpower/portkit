  api_overview: The 'globals' module is responsible for defining and managing the
    set of global variables used by the libxml2 library. Its primary function is to
    provide thread-local storage (TLS) for these variables, ensuring thread-safety
    in multi-threaded applications. Many of the direct API functions for setting these
    globals are deprecated, with the library moving towards per-parser options or
    direct per-thread function calls. It centralizes configuration for various library
    aspects like parser defaults, error handling, memory allocation, and I/O functions.
