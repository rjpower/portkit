  api_overview: The 'encoding' module in libxml2 is responsible for handling character
    encoding detection, parsing, and conversion. Its primary role is to enable XML
    and HTML parsers to correctly interpret and generate documents in various character
    sets by converting them to and from UTF-8, which is the internal encoding used
    by libxml2. It supports a wide range of standard encodings, provides mechanisms
    for alias management, and can leverage external libraries like iconv and ICU for
    broader encoding support.
