  api_overview: The c14n module provides implementations for "Canonical XML" (http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n),
    "Exclusive XML Canonicalization" (http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-exc-c14n), and Canonical
    XML 1.1. Its primary responsibility is to transform an XML document or a subset
    of it into a canonical form, which is a standardized physical representation.
    This process resolves ambiguities in XML serialization (e.g., whitespace, attribute
    order, namespace declarations) to ensure a consistent output, which is critical
    for applications like digital signatures where byte-for-byte identity is required.
    The module handles default attributes and resolves entity references, requiring
    documents to be loaded with XML_PARSE_DTDATTR | XML_PARSE_NOENT for full canonicalization.
