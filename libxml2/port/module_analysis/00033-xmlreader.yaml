  api_overview: The xmlreader module implements the xmlTextReader streaming node API,
    providing a forward-only, read-only cursor over an XML stream. It maps this high-level
    API onto libxml2's existing SAX-based parsing routines, optionally building a
    minimal tree structure as it progresses. Its primary responsibility is to enable
    efficient, low-memory consumption processing of XML documents by allowing applications
    to read XML data sequentially without loading the entire document into memory.
    It supports various input sources (files, memory, I/O callbacks) and integrates
    with validation (DTD, RelaxNG, XML Schema) and XInclude processing.
