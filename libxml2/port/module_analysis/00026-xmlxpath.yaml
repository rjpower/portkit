  api_overview: The xpath module provides a comprehensive implementation of the XML
    Path Language (XPath) as defined by the W3C Recommendation. Its primary responsibility
    is to enable addressing and selecting parts of an XML document using XPath expressions.
    It supports parsing, compiling, and evaluating XPath expressions against an XML
    document, managing the evaluation context, and handling various XPath data types
    (node-sets, booleans, numbers, strings). It is designed to be used by other modules
    like XSLT and XPointer.
