  api_overview: The 'dict' module provides a string dictionary (interning) mechanism
    within libxml2. Its primary responsibility is to store and manage a collection
    of unique strings, ensuring that identical strings are represented by the same
    memory address. This approach significantly reduces memory consumption by avoiding
    duplicate string allocations and enables highly efficient string comparisons (pointer
    equality). It solves the problem of redundant string storage and slow string comparisons
    in XML parsing and manipulation.
