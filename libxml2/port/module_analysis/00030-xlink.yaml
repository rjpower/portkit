  api_overview: The xlink module is an unfinished and deprecated component of libxml2,
    primarily designed for detecting and processing XML XLinks and HTML simple links
    within XML and HTML documents. Its main responsibility is to identify elements
    that conform to XLink specifications or common HTML linking patterns and, if configured,
    invoke user-defined callbacks upon detection. It aims to provide a programmatic
    interface for applications to react to hyperlinks found during document parsing.
    Due to its deprecated status, it is not recommended for new development.
