  api_overview: The xmlmemory module in libxml2 provides a wrapper layer over standard
    C memory allocation functions (malloc, realloc, free, strdup). Its primary purpose
    is to offer a centralized, debug-friendly, and customizable memory management
    interface for the libxml2 library. It tracks memory usage (total size and number
    of blocks), performs basic integrity checks (tag validation), and allows external
    applications to override the default memory allocation routines used by libxml2,
    which is crucial for integration with custom allocators or garbage collectors.
