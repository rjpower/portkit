  api_overview: The xmlregexp module provides a generic and extensible Regular Expression
    (RegExp) engine. Its primary responsibility is to compile and execute regular
    expressions, specifically designed to support validation mechanisms found in XML-related
    specifications such as XML 1.0 DTD validation, XML Schemas (Part 1 and Datatypes
    Part 2), and RELAX-NG/TREX. It transforms a regular expression string into a finite
    automaton for efficient matching.
