  api_overview: The 'uri' module provides a comprehensive set of routines for parsing,
    manipulating, and normalizing Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) in accordance
    with RFC 3986 (and older RFCs like 2396). Its primary responsibility is to represent
    URIs in a structured format (xmlURI), parse URI strings into this structure, serialize
    the structure back into a string, and handle URI resolution, normalization, escaping,
    and unescaping. It serves as a core component for correctly interpreting and manipulating
    URIs within the libxml2 library.
