  api_overview: This module provides generic threading-related routines for libxml2,
    offering synchronization primitives like simple and reentrant mutexes. It also
    manages library-wide thread-safe initialization and cleanup, ensuring that global
    resources are set up and torn down correctly in multi-threaded environments. It
    abstracts away platform-specific threading APIs (POSIX threads, Windows Critical
    Sections).
