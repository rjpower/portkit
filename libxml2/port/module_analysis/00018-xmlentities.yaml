  api_overview: The 'entities' module in libxml2 is responsible for managing XML entity
    declarations. It provides functions for creating, adding, retrieving, and freeing
    XML entities, including predefined entities (like &lt;, &amp;), general entities,
    and parameter entities. It handles their storage within a document's DTD (internal
    or external subset) and provides utilities for escaping special characters into
    their entity or character reference forms for XML output.
