  api_overview: The nanohttp module formerly provided a minimal HTTP client implementation
    for libxml2, used for fetching resources like external DTDs or schemas. As of
    libxml2 version 2.15, the actual HTTP client functionality has been removed. This
    module now serves solely as a collection of ABI (Application Binary Interface)
    compatibility stubs. All public functions within this module are deprecated and
    return default 'failure' values (e.g., NULL, -1, 0) without performing any network
    operations. Its primary purpose is to allow applications compiled against older
    libxml2 versions to link successfully, even if they call these deprecated HTTP
    functions, preventing crashes due to missing symbols. New development should not
    use these functions.
