  api_overview: The xmlstring module provides a comprehensive set of utility functions
    for manipulating strings within the libxml2 library. Its primary responsibility
    is to handle `xmlChar` strings, which are typically used for UTF-8 encoded XML
    data. It offers functionalities analogous to standard C string functions (e.g.,
    `strdup`, `strcmp`, `strcat`, `strstr`) but adapted for the `xmlChar` type, along
    with specialized routines for UTF-8 character and string validation, length calculation,
    and substring extraction based on character count rather than byte count. This
    module is fundamental for all string operations within libxml2, ensuring correct
    handling of multi-byte character encodings.
