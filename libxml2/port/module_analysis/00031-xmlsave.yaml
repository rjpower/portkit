  api_overview: The xmlsave module provides the core functionality for serializing
    XML and HTML documents, or subtrees of documents, to various output destinations.
    It handles character encoding conversion, output formatting (indentation, newlines),
    and specific rules for XML, HTML, and XHTML serialization, including DTD declarations
    and attribute handling. Its primary responsibility is to convert an in-memory
    libxml2 document tree into a byte stream.
