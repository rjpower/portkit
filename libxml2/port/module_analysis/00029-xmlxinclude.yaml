  api_overview: The xinclude module implements the W3C XML Inclusions (XInclude) 1.0
    specification. Its primary responsibility is to process 'xi:include' elements
    within an XML document. It resolves these elements by fetching content from specified
    URIs (either XML or plain text), applying XPointer expressions if present, and
    then replacing the 'xi:include' element with the included content. It handles
    recursion, loop detection, and fallback mechanisms, effectively merging external
    content into a single XML infoset.
