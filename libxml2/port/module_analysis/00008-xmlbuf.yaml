  api_overview: The buf module in libxml2 provides robust and efficient memory buffer
    management. Its primary responsibility is to handle dynamic memory buffers for
    various libxml2 operations, ensuring memory safety, 64-bit compatibility, and
    improved control over allocations. It introduces a new opaque xmlBuf structure
    and its associated API, which is intended to replace the older, deprecated xmlBuffer
    API. This module is fundamental for I/O operations, parsing, and tree manipulation
    within libxml2, providing the underlying storage for data streams and document
    content.
