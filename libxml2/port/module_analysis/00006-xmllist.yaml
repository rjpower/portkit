  api_overview: This module provides a generic, doubly linked list implementation.
    It allows storing arbitrary void* data pointers and offers a comprehensive set
    of operations for list management, including creation, deletion, insertion, removal,
    searching, traversal, and manipulation (e.g., sorting, reversing, merging, copying).
    The list supports custom data deallocation and comparison functions, making it
    highly adaptable for various data types and ordering requirements. It uses a sentinel
    node for simplified list boundary handling.
