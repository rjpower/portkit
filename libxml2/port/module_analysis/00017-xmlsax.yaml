  api_overview: The SAX2 module in libxml2 provides the default SAX2 (Simple API for
    XML) handler implementation. Its primary responsibility is to build an in-memory
    XML Document Object Model (DOM) tree from the SAX events generated by the XML
    parser. It translates low-level parsing events (like start/end elements, character
    data, entity declarations) into the construction of `xmlDoc` and `xmlNode` structures,
    effectively creating the parsed XML tree. It also handles DTD processing, entity
    resolution, and basic validation checks during tree construction.
