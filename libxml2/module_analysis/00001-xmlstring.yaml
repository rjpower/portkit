  api_overview: |
    Provides fundamental string manipulation utilities specifically designed for libxml2's 
    xmlChar* type and UTF-8 encoding. This is a foundational module with no dependencies 
    on other libxml2 modules. Functions handle string duplication, comparison, concatenation,
    UTF-8 validation and character extraction, and formatted string creation.
    
    Implementation notes:
    - Uses libxml2 memory management (xmlMalloc/xmlFree)
    - All functions operate on xmlChar* (unsigned char*)
    - Includes comprehensive UTF-8 support
    - Can be implemented as pure Rust with UTF-8 string handling
