# Specification Rules

A formal specification has the following format:

* Proposal: 1-3 paragraphs outlining the project plan and goals. Why is it important?
* Deliverables: What specific outcome will be delivered by the project. This should be a specific list of artifacts that you will generate, e.g. a testing framework supporting these features.
* Risks: What are the key risks in how you write the code? Write down any questions or ambiguities in the initial request and provide your best answer to them here.
* Testing plan: How will you verify your work is correct? What tests will you write?
* Execution Plan: The meat of the proposal, what are the specific files you will create and in which order?
  - Tests, if relevant, always come first. Which test files, and where? How will you ensure thorough testing? Tests should demonstrate idiomatic usage of any new APIs. Be sure to include example usage _in your specification_, don't leave this for later.
  - After tests, break the core functionality down and outline each file and what it will contain.
* Validation: How will you validate the proposal was implemented successfully?
